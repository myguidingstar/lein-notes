{"name":"Lein-notes","body":"lein-notes\r\n======\r\n\r\nSimple Leiningen plugin to read inline notes in the source codes. Just\r\ncame to Clojure from a few years in Ruby and I miss the 'rake notes'\r\nto show inline notes in the source. I don't seem to find a Clojure\r\nreplacement for it so I decided to write one. This is one of my very\r\nfirst Clojure project so the codes are a bit messy but it gets the job\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Leiningen 1.x\r\n```\r\n% lein plugin install myguidingstar/lein-notes 0.0.2\r\n```\r\n## Leiningen 2.x\r\n\r\nadd it to ~/.lein/profiles.clj:\r\n```clojure\r\n{:user {:plugins [[myguidingstar/lein-notes \"0.0.2\"]]}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRight now, this reads FIXME, TODO and OPTIMIZE in all source codes and\r\nskip the classes/, .git/ and lib/ directories. The output is a bit\r\nrough\r\n\r\n$ lein notes\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 David Li and Hoang Minh Thang\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.\r\n","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
